# Cloud Computing and Data Security Proposal for TechSolutionsInc.

## Project Overview
This proposal outlines a comprehensive cloud computing and data security strategy for TechSolutionsInc., leveraging Amazon AWS services. The project focuses on migrating the company's IT infrastructure to the cloud while addressing potential security risks and implementing robust countermeasures.

## Key Features

### 1. **Cloud Services Offered**
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: Recommended product: **Amazon EC2** for scalability, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness.
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: Runtime environment for application testing.
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: End-user applications with minimal management overhead.
- **Deployment Models**: Cloud, Hybrid, and **On-premises (private)** for enhanced security.

### 2. **Benefits of Cloud Computing**
- **Resilience and Elasticity**: Unlimited storage, better computing power, and fully managed IT infrastructure.
- **Flexibility and Scalability**: On-demand resources and reduced network latency.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Redundant applications across multiple servers.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay-as-you-go model for efficient resource management.

### 3. **Security Risks and Countermeasures**
#### **Identified Vulnerabilities**:
- Data Storage Cryptography Vulnerabilities.
- Data Access Vulnerabilities.
- Data Storage Location, Backup, and Recovery Vulnerabilities.

#### **Security Countermeasures**:
- **Encryption and Key Management**: AES, RSA, ElGamal, and Gentry schemes.
- **Data Classification and Access Control**: Three levels (Primary, Confidential, Highly Confidential) with IAM.
- **Digital Signature and Hashing**: Ensures data authenticity and integrity (e.g., MD5, SHA).
- **Additional Measures**: Trust Framework, Intrusion Detection/Prevention, Data Sanitization.

### 4. **Security Requirements**
- Privacy, Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Accountability, Authentication, and Authorization.

## Flowchart Summary
The proposal includes a flowchart linking vulnerabilities, countermeasures, and security requirements:
1. **Data Storage Cryptography Vulnerabilities** → Encryption → Confidentiality & Privacy.
2. **Data Access Vulnerabilities** → Data Classification & IAM → Confidentiality, Authentication, Authorization.
3. **Data Storage Location Vulnerabilities** → Digital Signature & Hashing → Integrity, Authentication.
